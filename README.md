## Dynamic Extension Nets for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation
Created by Lizhao Liu, Junyi Cao and Minqian Liu from South China University of Technology.

This repository contains the official PyTorch-implementation of our [ACM MM 2020 paper *Dynamic Extension Nets for Few-shot Semantic Segmentation*](#). In particular, we release the code for training and testing the DENet and our re-implemented methods for few-shot semantic segmentation under {1, 2}-way and {1, 5}-shot settings. 

#### Abstract
We propose a Dynamic Extension Network (DENet) in which we dynamically construct and maintain a classifier for the novel class by leveraging the knowledge from the base classes and the information from novel data. More importantly, to overcome the information suppression issue, we design a Guided Attention Module (GAM), which can be plugged into any framework to help learn class-relevant features. Last, rather than directly train the model with limited data, we propose a dynamic extension training algorithm to predict the weights of novel classifiers, which is able to exploit the knowledge of base classifiers by dynamically extending classes during training. The extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL-5ùëñ and COCO-20ùëñ datasets.
